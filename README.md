# Frame-U-Lator

This app was developed as a specialized calculator for tasks that construction workers often (and rapidly) have to compute.

The design prioritizes quick utilization over self explanatory UI, making it as rapidly employable a tool as possible. It 
is build to increase the speed and accuracy of many commonly preformed/required construction on-site computations
