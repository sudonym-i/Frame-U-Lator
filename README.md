# Frame-U-Lator
This is probably my first code project. The code is definitely far from efficient, and so many elements were poorly constructed, but at the end of the day it works. (includes HTML optimized for desktop web, and an APK file for use on android phones)

HTML will be the main code, and inside a folder labelles "mobile" will be all of the files for the mobile APK

This app was developed as a specialized calculator for tasks that construction workers often (and rapidly) have to compute
